# 📊 HR Analytics - Predict Employee Attrition

## 🔍 Objective:
To analyze HR data and predict employee attrition using exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and machine learning models. This helps organizations understand patterns behind resignations and make strategic HR decisions.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Power BI**: For building insightful dashboards
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For code execution and EDA
- **Excel**: Initial data cleaning and formatting

## 🧾 Dataset:
A cleaned and preprocessed HR dataset containing employee records such as:
- Age, Gender, Department, Job Role  
- Monthly Income, Overtime, Job Satisfaction  
- Attrition status (Yes/No)

## ✅ Key Steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed null values and inconsistencies  
   - Converted binary flags (0/1) into readable labels (e.g., Yes/No)

2. **EDA and Feature Engineering**  
   - Visualized attrition patterns across departments and roles  
   - Identified top reasons for resignations using correlation & plots

3. **Model Building (Python)**  
   - Built logistic regression, decision tree & random forest models  
   - Evaluated accuracy, precision, and recall for each model  

4. **Power BI Dashboard**  
   - Created interactive visuals:
     - Total Employees, Resigned Employees
     - Attrition by Gender, Age, and Job Role
     - Monthly Income vs. Attrition
     - Resignation trends over time  

## 📈 Insights Derived:
- Overtime and low job satisfaction strongly correlate with resignations  
- Sales and HR departments show higher attrition rates  
- Employees aged 26–35 are most likely to resign  

## 📁 Deliverables:
- ✔️ Python code (`HR_Attrition_Prediction.ipynb`)  
- ✔️ Power BI dashboard (`HR_Attrition_Dashboard.pbix`)  
- ✔️ Cleaned dataset (`hr_data_cleaned.csv`)  
- ✔️ Report PDF with findings and visual snapshots

## 📌 Conclusion:
This project empowers HR teams to proactively identify at-risk employees and optimize retention strategies using data-driven insights.
